- Nov 08: Room TBD (probably ENR2 N595 or Harshbarger 110)


### Motivation
The Earth sciences, broadly defined, are undergoing a revolution where rapidly expanding computational capabilities and availability of large, public datasets are driving innovations in the research process. The rapid nature of these changes have made it challenging for the geoscience community to coalesce around norms and practices that could advance scientific impact and foster interdisciplinary collaboration. 

### Goals
To address these challenges within our community we are starting the “University of Arizona - Data Science for Earth” meetup which is specifically tailored to address several opportunities/challenges:
- Provide an outlet for researchers to share technical advances in the geosciences
- Build community across departments and disciplines for researchers 
- Contribute to an open knowledge base to accelerate research

### Resources
We aim to make many of the topics and materials that we discuss and showcase as a part of this meetup open and accessible. Most of our content is hosted under this GitHub organization, though we aim to make contributing easy for beginner git users. 

We host the community message board in the [discussions page](https://github.com/orgs/UA-DataScience4Earth/discussions) - this page can be used for questions, showcases, or feedback to the group. Specifically, each meetup there will be a roll call thread for participants to introduce themselves and what they are currently working on/interested in ([example roll call thread](https://github.com/orgs/UA-DataScience4Earth/discussions/1)). 

Additionally, we are building a [wiki](https://github.com/UA-DataScience4Earth/CommunityResources/wiki) which contains a community-driven knowledge base for Earth data science related topics. Anyone is welcome to make additions to the wiki, and we welcome new ideas for structuring and/or organizing our content.

### Format
To provide a venue for researchers who are interested in these goals we are proposing a regular weekly meetup which is informal and opt-in. We envision this effort to begin as an outlet for students and researchers who either work in, or want to learn more about, data science methods applied to geosciences. To support both new students and seasoned researchers we will use a split agenda which encompasses a 1.5 hour session.

(30 minute) Showcase: Researchers present technical aspects of their work. This may include topics highlighting software/data packages which they have been using/developing, sharing educational content they have developed, or providing on-the-ground perspectives.

(60 minute) Office hours: This portion is focused on skill-sharing for researchers. We will ask participants to make a 1-2 minute pitch that summarizes their practical, day-to-day research problems that they would like community input from. Based on these topics we hope that affinity groups will develop around certain topics. The focus of this portion will emphasize building mentorship around computational/data handling techniques.
